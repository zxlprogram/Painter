## feature description
	-KeyEvent ctrl+C: copy the choosing surface
	-KeyEvent up/right: make the choosing surface bigger(if there have surface have been choosed)
	-KeyEvent down/left: make the choosing surface smaller(if there have surface have been choosed)
	-keyEvent delete: delete the choosing surface(if there have surface have been choosed) or delete the highest layer surface
	-KeyEvent ctrl+Z: undo the step
	-KeyEvent ctrl+Y: redo the step
	-KeyEvent ctrl+S: save the file
	-KeyEvent ctrl+A: select all
	-ctrl+MouseWheelEvent: zoom in/out
	-ctrl+MouseClickedEvent: choosing multi-surface or point
	-MouseEvent left: when pressed, choosing surface will became null if the mouse didn't in any surface,otherwise choosing surface will became the highest layer surface, when dragged, it will check if the choosing point were exist,if it were exist than the point will follow the mouse; otherwise it will check if the choosing surface were exist, if it were exist than the surface will follow the mouse;if nothing were been choosed, we will translation All Object(it look like canvas translation but we actually move all surfaces)
	-MouseEvent right: change the color for choosing surface
	-Color changing: the textfield used to enter RGB, it is only allowed to enter the number which between 0 and 1, if the format is wrong, it will show the dialog to announce the error, you must enter the number again
	-dragging file: let the saving data added in your painter
	-Core: this app GUI is base on java swing
	-left side: the layer managing
	-up side: the tool list

## Possibly bug
	[linux]
	no known bug

	[windows]
	no known bug

## lacking feature
	-.png .svg support
	-user precise setting
	
## Requirements
	-Java 8
	-Windows 10+ or ubuntu

## download
	-https://github.com/zxlprogram/MYprogram/tree/master/Painter
	
## execution
	main app:
		-cd MYprogram/Painter/bin
		-java testing.Main
	
	browser:
		1.open cmd, path to the folder which have painterBrowser.jar
		2. .\painterBrowser.jar <your_painter_file_name.txt>
			exp: ".\painterBrowser.jar C:\Users\user\desktop\file.vecf"
			
		or visit the author and ask for Assets link to get the runnable file(.exe, Ubuntu binary file, .jar)
	
## Custom file protocol
	-file format: .vecf
	-at first line we have three number for scale, offsetX, offsetY, and below next line, it record for all of the PainterObj, for each PainterObj, we have a vocabilary, N points and a color,first vocabilary descripted the PaintObj class; every points have two doubles and color have three, each point's format:"X Y ",and than, " C " were followed, at last, Color format:"R G B" will followed behind, if the vocabilary at first word is G: means it is a group, and then at that line will have some PainterObj descripted and splited by ","

## How to get Assets (client)?
	1.ask for author and get a cloudflared webside
	2.open at chrome
	3.choice your file

## How to share Assets (server)?
	1. double click "Assets_sharing.bat"
	2. copy the webside in the ascii rectangle frame
	3. share the link to client
	notice: you should have python and cloudflared, and connect them to the system path,the name of cloudflared should named to "cloudflared.exe"
	notice: this sharing method is only work in windows, it doesn't work in other OS, because the bat file wrote the windows cmd code
	notice: if you want to make a same sharing tool, you should download cloudflared and python in your OS

	the abstract method to share the assets:
		download python and connect to system path
		download cloudflared and connect to system path
		1.python -m http.server 8000
		2.cloudflared tunnel --url "http://localhost:8000"
